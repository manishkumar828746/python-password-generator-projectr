Excited to share my latest Python projectâ€”a fully-functional Password Generator! from the #CodSoft internship under the guidance of Mr. Divakar Kushwaha Sir from Ducat Noida!

### Project Overview:
I recently developed a Python-based password generator that can create secure, random passwords to enhance online security. This project not only helped me enhance my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of Python's functionalities and GUI libraries.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python:** For core logic implementation.
- **Tkinter:** For creating the user-friendly graphical interface.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** To structure the project efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Random Character Selection:** Uses Python's `random` module to select characters randomly from different character sets.
- **Length Customization:** Allows users to specify the desired length of the password.
- **Character Mix:** Includes options to mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols to create robust passwords.
- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
- **Error Handling:** Effective management of common input errors.
- **Extendable:** Designed to easily incorporate additional features.


Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! ðŸ˜Š
